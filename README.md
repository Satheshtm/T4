# TASK DESCRIPTION:
# Project Title:
# Step and Fitness Tracker App with Real-Time Updates and Data Visualization

# ðŸ”¸ Description:
This project focuses on building an Android mobile application that helps users track their physical activityâ€”specifically their steps walked, distance covered, and calories burned. The app utilizes Android's built-in sensors such as the Step Detector and Accelerometer, which allow for low-power and accurate tracking without requiring additional hardware.

The primary goal is to create a lightweight, real-time fitness tracking solution that continuously monitors a userâ€™s movement throughout the day and presents the data in a visually engaging and easy-to-understand format using graphs and statistics.

âœ… Core Features:
1. Step Tracking (Pedometer):
The app uses Androidâ€™s Sensor.TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR or Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER to count the number of steps the user takes.

The step count is automatically updated in real time as the user walks.

2. Distance Calculation:
Distance is estimated based on the step count and user-specific stride length.

Users may optionally input height or stride length to improve accuracy.

3. Calories Burned Estimation:
The app calculates calories burned using a basic formula:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Calories Burned = Steps Ã— 0.04 (approx. based on average weight)
Advanced versions may factor in age, weight, and activity intensity for better results.

4. Real-Time Updates:
The app runs in the background and updates the data continuously as the user moves.

Updates are shown instantly in the app interface.

5. Data Visualization:
Step count, distance, and calories are displayed using:

Line charts

Bar graphs

Progress circles or gauges

Visualization helps users understand their daily, weekly, and monthly performance.

6. Daily Goals and Progress:
Users can set daily goals (e.g., 10,000 steps).

The app shows progress toward the goal in real-time.

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used:
Android SDK (Kotlin/Java)

SensorManager to access built-in step and motion sensors

LiveData / ViewModel for real-time data updates

MPAndroidChart for charts and graphs

Material Design UI for clean and modern interface

ðŸ§  How It Works:
When the user opens the app, it requests permission to access physical activity data.

Android sensors begin counting steps in the background.

The app calculates total steps, distance, and calories.

The UI updates automatically and displays the information through intuitive visual elements.

The data is reset daily, and users can view past performance summaries.

ðŸŽ¯ Deliverable:
A fully functional fitness tracking Android app that:

Tracks steps, distance, and calories burned using Android sensors.

Displays results using real-time updates and interactive data visualizations.

Works without internet, leveraging device sensors only.

ðŸš€ Optional Future Enhancements:
Sync with Google Fit or Fitbit.

Save user history locally or in cloud (using Room or Firebase).

Add reminders for hydration or movement.

Share daily progress with friends.

This project is ideal for demonstrating the integration of hardware sensors, real-time data processing, and UI data visualization in Android. It provides practical use for health-conscious users and is highly relevant in today's fitness-aware world.
